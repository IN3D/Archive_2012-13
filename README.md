Java_Extracurricular
====================

My Java professor contacted a few other students and myself outside of class through e-mail about doing some extra work outside the scope of the course. The project involves using Apache Tomcat to create servlets and JSPs through Eclipse.

<b>I completed this project using:</b>
JDK 1.7
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse 4.3.1 "Kepler"</a>
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat v6.0</a>
