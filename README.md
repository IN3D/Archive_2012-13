<h3>Update 10/22/13</h3>
<br/>
This book has several errors in the code that have made using it a diffucult learning experience.
As of 10/22/13 I'm setting this project down, in hopes of finding a book that will be better for learning from.

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<br/>
This project is inspired from the book "Pro Javascript for Web Apps" by Apress.
The project source code can be found at <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430244615">their website</a>,
in the source code tab.
<br/>
This project was begun from Chapter 1 of the book.


--Use this structure for the project--
<br/>
master: only for release<br/>
devel: this is the development branch. This one should always work (tests can’t be broken)<br/>
topic/$name: when we start to develop a new feature, we create a topic branch<br/>
hotfix/$name: when we need to release a new version right now, without merging devel before, we create a hofrix branch<br/>
release/$version: when we’re ready to ship, we create a new branch<br/>
