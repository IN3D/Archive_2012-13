##Archive: 2012 - 2013
####A collection of projects that I worked on while in college.
---
I decided to collect up all of my old smaller projects that I had worked on while I was in college.  As I continued to grow and learn more I wanted to reduce the "clutter" of excess repos that only contained very small projects.  What is contained in this archive are small projects I started, usually to try and work with a specific idea or technology. I'll try and set a precedent with this, any repos that were started for a single purpose (idea/technology/etc) will get archived up every year or so.

TL; DR: I like clean.

Here is a synopsis of what's in each sub-directory

---
**[Battletech Database:](https://github.com/IN3D/Archive_2012-13/tree/master/Battletech_Database)**
This was just a very quick little project to fiddle around with a database in OpenOffice. I was just working with the
idea of relational databases, as long as staying honed with basic skills.

**[Binary Converter:](https://github.com/IN3D/Archive_2012-13/tree/master/BinaryConverter)**
This project ties in with the binary reversal program. I was trying to get the binary reversal program to work and
ended up with this as a first working product. It isn't what the challenege called for but I still thought it was cool.

**[Binary Reversal:](https://github.com/IN3D/Archive_2012-13/tree/master/BinaryReversal)**
An answer to one of the spotify programming challenges. This project is supposed to take in a decimal number and then
return it's binary representation, but in reverse.

**[BitCalc:](https://github.com/IN3D/Archive_2012-13/tree/master/BitCalc)**
A very incomplete project. This was an idea I had to create a bitwise calculator for the iPhone/learn more about
about Objective-C. Between the expense of the putting something in the AppStore and honestly not liking Objective-C
very much, I dropped it.

**[Feudal:](https://github.com/IN3D/Archive_2012-13/tree/master/Feudal)**
A project me and a buddy started up. We learned a lot, and got some good experience out of it programming as a team
(how I found GitHub!) but the project became an incredebly heavy burden. We were making a game from scratch both in
the sense of code, and that we were making up all the game rules and story. We were doing so much game design it started
detracting from actually writing the program. In the end, it was great fun and a great learning experience.

**[MechWarrior Character Generator (Old):](https://github.com/IN3D/Archive_2012-13/tree/master/MechWarrior_CharGen_OLD)**
A prototype of a project I am still going to work on. One of the main reasons that this prototype was scrapped was just
"environmental" reasons. The state I live in, I've learned; is a **huge** Microsoft state. To the point a few of the
recruiters I've spoken with suggested they can have trouble finding Java positions from time to time. So the project
will be switched over to a C# project. Secondly, I'm going to make the project in line with the current game products.
the Mechwarrior RPG is currently on 4th edition, so I'm going to switch the project over.

**[Save the Humans:](https://github.com/IN3D/Archive_2012-13/tree/master/SaveTheHumans)**
A simple little game I worked on out of "Head First: C#". It plays something like an old arcade game. There's an exit,
which you have to get the player element onto. As the game keeps going more and more enemies (red circles) continue to spawn. Which creates a natural increase in difficulty as the game progresses.

**[Schoolwork:](https://github.com/IN3D/Archive_2012-13/tree/master/SchoolWork_and_PersonalImprovement)**
Kind of a meta archive. These are a collection of the small weekly projects I was assigned while in college. There are also a few that I went out and tried learning on my own (the work from a couple of Zed Shaw's "Learn X the Hard Way" are in there).
