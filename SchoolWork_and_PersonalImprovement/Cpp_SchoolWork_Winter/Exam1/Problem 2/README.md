Exam 01: Part 2
====================

Programming Challenge #2, Chapter 11.

This one was the unexpected, but it was pretty straightforward. It involved taking in an integer 
to represent a day of the year. It required a simple validity check that the number entered was not less than 1
or greater than 365. The book didn't suggest any particular lengths for the months (the question was actually very open ended),
so I just used the lengths of the months this year (2014). a print() function checks to see which month it belongs in.
When the month is greater than January, it subtracts the length(s) of the previous months from the entered number.
