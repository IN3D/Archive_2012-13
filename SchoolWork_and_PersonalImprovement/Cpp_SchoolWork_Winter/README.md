C++ School Work: Winter 2014
====================

Work done for my C++ class in the Winter of 2014.

The class' book was <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Early-Objects-8th/dp/013336092X/ref=la_B001I9Q67I_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1382833820&sr=1-7">Starting out with C++: Early Objects (8th)</a></b>.

This class is entitled "Advanced C++", and many of the projects involve more logic than the previous semester. On projects where it makes sense to do so, I'll provide a breakdown of my logic for how I approached the problem.

The professor for this class has requested some very particular style/format for our files. The spacing requested seems excessive, so I'll try and upload what I feel is best style practice.
