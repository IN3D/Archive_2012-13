Java_XML
=========

There is a program that I'm very fond of called <a href="http://megamek.info/">MegaMek</a>; a Java implementation of the board game Battletech. I was reading through the source code, and it seemed that it managed all of it's data through XML files. So I looked up how to go about parsing an XML file with Java and came up with this little program to parse out an XML file that holds some basic employee data.
