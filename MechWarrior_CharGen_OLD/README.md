Q: Why 3rd Edition, and not 4th?
<br/>
A: As a short answer, I just like 3rd better. It definately has it's flaws, but
I've always felt like characters made in 4th are significantly more plain feeling
than ones from 3rd. Secondly, it presents a nice challenge, the life paths present
a lot of situational challenges that don't exist in 4th.
